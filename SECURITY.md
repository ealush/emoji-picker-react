## Reporting a Vulnerability

To ensure the safety of our users, please **do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues**, discussions, or pull requests.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in `emoji-picker-react`, please report it to the maintainer directly via email:

**security@ealush.com**

### What to Include

To help us triage and prioritize your report, please include:

1.  **Type of issue** (e.g., XSS, prototype pollution, DoS).
2.  **Full paths** of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the bug.
3.  **Proof of Concept (PoC)** or clear steps to reproduce the issue.
4.  **Impact assessment** (how an attacker could exploit this).

## Response Timeline (SLA)

We are committed to the following response timeline for valid security reports:

- **Acknowledgment:** Within 48 hours.
- **Triage & Validation:** Within 5 business days.
- **Patch Release:** Critical issues are prioritized for immediate resolution.

## Disclosure Policy

We follow a **Coordinated Disclosure** model:

1.  You report the vulnerability privately.
2.  We verify the issue and develop a fix.
3.  We release a patched version of the package.
4.  We publish a GitHub Security Advisory (GHSA) detailing the issue and crediting you (if desired).
5.  You are then free to publish your findings.

## Safe Harbor

We consider security research to be "safe" if you:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service.
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder.
- Wait until we have patched the vulnerability before disclosing it publicly.

We will not pursue legal action against researchers who follow these guidelines.
